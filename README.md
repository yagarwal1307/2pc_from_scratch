# 2PC from scratch
This is a just a "2PC 1 gate evaluation" implementation where both alice and bob's inputs are taken from them and result is evaluated without anyone of them knowing other's input.
There is some leakage about information but that is gate level and not the protocol level.

This repository is just an implementation of MPC from scratch tutorial from Zellix.
